# Contributing to Projection Engine

Thanks for your interest in helping build **Projection Engine** — a framework for modeling cross-domain system behavior via adaptive eigenstructures and projection dynamics.

This project is currently in its **seed stage**, meaning that the foundational concepts are in place, but the implementation is just beginning. We’re building tools that let systems across physics, cognition, and economics be explored through shared mathematical language.

## 🧠 Who This Is For

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds:

* **Physicists**: Help us frame simulations grounded in thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, or field theory.
* **Economists & Market Analysts**: Map feedback loops and resolution flows in price discovery.
* **Cognitive Scientists**: Model attention and perception through dynamic projection.
* **ML Engineers & Developers**: Build simulation engines, visualizers, and tools.
* **Systems Thinkers**: Suggest analogies and mappings across domains.

You do **not** need deep math skills to contribute — just curiosity and a systems mindset.

## 🧩 How You Can Help

Here are some ways to get involved:

### 1. Start a Conversation

Open an [Issue](https://github.com/KLRico/projection_engine/issues) to:

* Share resonance you notice between domains
* Ask questions about projection theory
* Suggest improvements to our framework or docs

### 2. Help with Our First RFC

We’re launching `RFC #1: Heat vs Attention Diffusion` — a demo comparing how heat and attention spread can be simulated with nearly identical math. Join the conversation [here](https://github.com/KLRico/projection_engine/issues/1).

### 3. Improve the Docs

* Clarify the README, Philosophy, or upcoming Roadmap
* Translate ideas into examples
* Add illustrations or metaphors

### 4. Prototype Tools

Interested in coding?

* Build projection visualizers
* Implement eigenmode comparison tools
* Create Jupyter demos

### 5. Suggest Seeds

Have a model that “vibrates like” something else?
Propose a **seed structure** — a domain-specific representation of tension → resolution using known math.

## 🌿 Guiding Ethos

> "Model what vibrates alike, and you may solve what seemed unrelated."

This project is exploratory, optimistic, and open-ended. If that sounds like you, you're in the right place.

We’re not just building simulations — we’re trying to build *shared understanding across reality’s fractured languages*.

Let us know how you'd like to help — or where you're stuck — and we’ll work with you to find a fit. Reach out via GitHub issues or directly through comments on seed documents.
