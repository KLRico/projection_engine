## 🧠 The Big Idea
**Projection Engine** provides tools to model physical, cognitive, and economic systems as *dynamic projections of shared mathematical structures*. Just as light passing through different lenses creates distinct patterns, we show how:
- Quantum wavefunctions 🌀
- Financial markets 📈
- Neural processes 🧠
- Fluid dynamics 🌊 
...all emerge from **common eigenstructures** when viewed through domain-specific projections.

## ✨ Why This Matters
Traditional models treat domains as isolated silos. Projection Engine reveals how:

A[Universal Eigenstructures] --> B[Physics Projection]
A --> C[Cognition Projection]
A --> D[Market Projection]
B --> E[Navier-Stokes]
C --> F[Attention Dynamics]
D --> G[Price Discovery]
```
*We provide the "lens adapter" to translate insights across scientific boundaries.* [See Philosophy →](docs/philosophy.md)

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities
1. **Cross-Domain Simulation**  
   Run parallel simulations showing heat diffusion ≈ attention spread
2. **Dynamic Projection**  
   Adaptive basis rotation for evolving systems
3. **Eigenmode Analysis**  
   Extract structural signatures from any system
4. **Tension-Resolving Models**  
   Quantify how systems collapse uncertainty

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Installation
```bash
pip install projection-engine  # Coming soon!
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from projection_engine import System, Projector

# Define a market system
market = System(
    equation="∂p/∂t = μ∇²p + β⋅volatility",
    domain="economics"
)

# Compare to fluid dynamics
fluid = System(
    equation="∂v/∂t = α∇²v + ρ⋅pressure",
    domain="physics"
)

# Analyze shared eigenmodes
similarity = Projector.compare_eigenmodes(market, fluid)
print(f"Structural similarity: {similarity:.2%}")
# Output: Structural similarity: 78.34%
```
